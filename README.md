# Mocksmith

This is a work in progress, still unreleased.

Mocksmith is a command line program and a Rust library to generate mocks for the
Google Mock framework for testing of C++ units. The tool uses libclang to parse
C++ code and can generate complete header files or just mock class code.

More information to come!
